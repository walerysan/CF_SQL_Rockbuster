# CF_SQL_Rockbuster
**Query-based summary of inventory and revenues of an online video rental store using PostgreSQL** <br>
_Analysis performed for learning purposes with CareerFoundry_

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a fictive brick and mortar movie rental company with stores around the world. The management plans to use existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service.

The goal of the project is to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. This has been achived by exploring the inventory and revenues of the stores by using relational database management system. The findings has been communicated and visualized in Tableau and PowerPoint.

The repository contains:
1. Data dictionary
1. Entity relationship diagram
1. Selected PostgreSQL queries
1. Visualizations of queries results in Tableau
1. Presentation of insights in PowerPoint


During this project, I learned the SQL concept from the very begining. The exercises walked me through most important steps in the process of the data analysis.

First, It was important to understand the relationships that exist in the Rockbuster database and get an overview of all the tables. The snowflake-type entity relationship diagram was exctracted using the DbVisualizer. The list of all the fact and dimension tables along with data types, keys and column descriptions were collected in the Data dictionary.
